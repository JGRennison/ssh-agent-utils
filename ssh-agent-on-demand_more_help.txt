Files:
Config file format: Confirm and lifetime apply to the previous keyfile
or if at the beginning, all keyfiles in the config file.

keyfile file
	Use this key file. ~/ is expanded to $HOME/, no other expansions are
	performed.
confirm
	Equivalent to -c. Require confirmation to sign using identities.
lifetime life
	Equivalent to -t. Set lifetime (in seconds) when adding identities.

Note:
	If multiple copies of the same public key are given with different
	confirm and lifetime options it is undefined which is used.
	Config files and public key files are reloaded if their
	modification date has changed when a client requests a key list.

Examples:
eval `bin/ssh-agent-on-demand -1sdFn -f ~/.ssh/your_config_file`
	Sets the ssh-agent for the current shell to ssh-agent-on-demand.
	Avoids creating a duplicate if a suitable on-demand agent is already
	running.
alias ssh='ssh-agent-on-demand -1dF -f ~/.ssh/your_config_file -e ssh'
	Alias ssh to use ssh-agent-on-demand.
ssh-agent-on-demand ~/.ssh/your_key_file.pub -t "10m" -c -e ssh your_host
	Run ssh with an additional on-demand key, which if added will
	have a 10 minute lifetime and require conformation on each use.
