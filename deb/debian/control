Description: SSH-agent on demand
 This is a semi-transparent ssh-agent proxy which can add public key(s) to the
 public key identity response produced by the ssh-agent, if not already
 present. If the client then requests that the agent sign with a key which was
 added to the response, (ie. the real ssh-agent does not have the corresponding
 private key), ssh-add is called to add the corresponding private key
 on-demand, which then uses `SSH_ASKPASS` as necessary. This is useful for
 pass-phrase protected private keys which are not automatically loaded and/or
 which have a limited lifetime. The pass-phrase need only be entered when the
 key is used for the first time, or after it has expired.
 This avoids having to manually remember to (re-)add the required key before
 attempting to use it, if it is not loaded/expired.
 When used with agent-forwarding, it also avoids the need to switch to another
 shell to run ssh-add. Optionally, this can also add the public key file
 comment to the corresponding key data comment returned by the real agent.
